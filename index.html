                </h3>
                <p class="text-justify">
Large language models can encode a wealth of semantic knowledge about the world. Such knowledge could in principle be extremely useful to robots aiming to act upon high-level, temporally extended instructions expressed in natural language.
However, a significant weakness of language models is that they lack contextual grounding, which makes it difficult to leverage them for decision making within a given real-world context. 
For example, asking a language model to describe how to clean a spill might result in a reasonable narrative, but it may not be applicable to a particular agent, such as a robot, that needs to perform this task in a particular environment. 
We propose to provide this grounding by means of pretrained behaviors, which are used to condition the model to propose natural language actions that are both feasible and contextually appropriate. 
The robot can act as the language model’s “hands and eyes,” while the language model supplies high-level semantic knowledge about the task. 
We show how low-level tasks can be combined with large language models so  that  the  language  model  provides  high-level  knowledge about the procedures for performing complex and temporally extended instructions,  while  value  functions  associated  with  these  tasks  provide  the  grounding necessary to connect this knowledge to a particular physical environment. 
We evaluate our method on a number of real-world robotic tasks, where we show that this approach is capable of completing long-horizon,  abstract,  natural language instructions on a mobile manipulator.

                    Approach
                </h3>
                <p class="text-justify">
                Imagine a robot operating in a kitchen that is capable of executing skills such as "pick up the coffee cup" or "go to the sink".
To get the robot to use these skills to perform a complex task (e.g. "I spilled my drink, can you help?"), the user could manually break it up into steps consisting of these atomic commands. 
			However,this would be exceedingly tedious. A language model can split the high-level instruction ("I spilled my drink, can you help?") into sub-tasks, but it cannot do that effectively unless it has the context of what the robot is capable of given the abilities, current state of the robot and its environment.
<br><br>
When querying existing large language models, we see that a language model queried with "I spilled my drink, can you help?" may respond with "You could try using a vaccuum cleaner" or "I'm sorry, I didn't mean to spill it".
                <p style="text-align:center;">
        	    <image src="img/gpt3-cropped2.png" class="img-responsive">
                </p>
While these responses sound reasonable, they are not feasible to execute with the robot's capabilities in its current environment.  
<br><br>
The main principle that we use to connect LLMs to physical tasks is to observe that, in addition of asking the LLM to simply interpret an instruction, we can use it to score the likelihood that an individual skill makes progress towards completing the high-level instruction.
Furthermore, if each skill has an accompanying affordance function that quantifies how likely it is to succeed from the current state (such as a learned value function), its value can be used to weight the skill's likelihood.
                <p style="text-align:center;">
        	    <image src="img/saycan-llm.gif" class="img-responsive">
                </p>
<br><br>
Once the skill is selected, we execute it on the robot, the process proceeds by iteratively selecting a task and appending it to the instruction.
Practically, we structure the planning as a dialog between a user and a robot, in which a user provides the high level-instruction, e.g. "How would you bring me a coke can?" and the language model responds with an explicit sequence e.g. "I would: 1. Find a coke can, 2. Pick up the coke can, 3. Bring it to you, 4. Done".  
                <p style="text-align:center;">
        	    <image src="img/saycan.png" class="img-responsive">        	   
                </p>
In summary, given a high-level instruction, SayCan combines probabilities from a language model (representing the probability that a skill is useful for the instruction) with the probabilities from a value function (representing the probability of successfully executing said skill) to select the skill to perform. This emits a skill that is both possible and useful. The process is repeated by appending the selected skill to robot response and querying the models again, until the output step is to terminate.

                    Results
                </h3>
		<p class="text-justify">
		We benchmarked the proposed algorithm Saycan in two scenes, an office kitchen and a mock office kitchen with 101 tasks specified by natural 
			langauge instructions. Below we show some highlights of the results.
		</p>
		
		<p class="text-justify">
			We visualize the decision making process of SayCan. The blue bar indicates (normalized) LLM probability and the red bar 
			indicates (normalized) probability of 
			successful execution of selected skills. The combined score is in green bar, 
			and the algorithm choose the skill with highest combined score. This visualization
			highlights the interpretability of SayCan.
		</p>
		    
		<p class="text-justify">
			Given the task "I spilled my coke, can you bring me something to clean it up?", SayCan successfully planned and executed the following 
			steps 1. Find a sponge 2. Pick up the sponge
			3. Bring it to you 4. Done. As shown below:
	        </p>
                <p style="text-align:center;">
                    <image src="img/qualitative_1.png"  class="img-responsive" height="600px">
                </p>
			
		
		<p class="text-justify">
			However, if we slightly tweak the task to "I spilled my coke, can you bring me a replacement", SayCan planned the following steps instead
			1. Find a coke can 2. Pick up the coke can
			3. Bring it to you 4. Done. This highlights that SayCan is able to leverage the large capacity of LLMs, 
			where their semantic knowledge about the world can be useful both for interpreting instructions
			and understanding how to execute them.
	        </p>
			
		  <p style="text-align:center;">

                </p>
			  
		<p> In the next example, SayCan leverages the ability of the affordances to "override" the language model; though the language model believes picking up the sponge is the right skill, the affordances are aware this isn't possible and instead "find a sponge" is chosen. This highlights the necessity of affordance grounding.

		The proposed method can scale to long horizon tasks involving multiple steps, for example, for the task "I spilled my coke on the table,

                <font color="#5a00b4">PaLM-SayCan enables new capabilities. First, we show that it is very easy to incorporate new skills into the system, and use drawer manipulation as an example. Second, we show by leveraging chain of thought reasoning, we are able to solve tasks that requires reasoning. Finally we show the system can work with multilingual queries, without explicitly being designed to.</font>
            </p>

                
                <font color="#5a00b4">PaLM-SayCan is capable of integrating new skills by simply adding the new skills as options for the LLM and provide accompanying value functions and add an example in the prompt with that skill. For example, with the skills open, close, and go to the drawer, PaLM-SayCan is capable of solving tasks such as “restock the coke and pepsi into the drawer”.</font>

                <font color="#5a00b4">It can also solve the task "Bring me the rice chips from the drawer". Note the robot only has one arm, so it needs to plan a long sequence to first take rice chips out of drawer and place on counter, and then pick it up again after closing the drawer. </font>

                <font color="#5a00b4">SayCan can be integrated with recent work improving LLM reasoning, such as <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11903">Chain of Thought</a>. With chain-of-thought prompting, PaLM-SayCan is able to handle tasks that require reasoning.</font>

                <p>
                <font color="#5a00b4">While not explicitly designed to work with multilingual queries, PaLM-SayCan is able to handle them. The LLM was trained on a multilingual corpus and thus SayCan can handle multilingual queries other than English. There is almost no performance drop on planning success rate when changing the queries from English to Chinese, French and Spanish.</font>

                <p>
                <font color="#5a00b4">As presented herein, PaLM-SayCan only receives environmental feedback through value functions at the current decision step, meaning if a skill fails or the environment changes, the necessary feedback may not be available. Owing to the extendibility and the natural language interface, follow up work builds upon PaLM-SayCan to enable closed-loop planning by leveraging environment feedback (from e.g., success detectors, scene descriptors, or even human feedback) through an <a href="https://innermonologue.github.io/"> inner monologue </a>.</font>
